## Formula 1 Google Doodle

Formula 1 is the highest level of international racing for open wheel formula racing cars. Formula 1 has gathered a global audience of who gather to watch drivers push some of the fastest vehicles in the world. I chose to create a google doodle that celebrates speed and include an interaction which could give users just a small taste of racing. I always enjoyed the Google Doodles I could interact with especially back in elementary school because they would be great fun distractions from doing work and were on every school computer. I'm glad to say that I have recreated that distraction as of writing this now. The combination of both simple and highly detailed models places a focus on the game mechanics. The Google Doodle uses rhetorical tropes of allusion and hyperbole to add depth to the entire composition. The best part is when you drive the car over the finish line straight, and the camera angle is just right to let you see the entire Google logo for the first time during the entire circuit.
